The program should define a function named calculate_area(radius) that takes the radius of the circle as an input parameter. The function should return the computed area, using the formula Area = 𝜋 × radius ^2, where 𝜋 π is approximately 3.14159. The program should prompt the user to input the radius and then display the calculated area.\n","\n","Double-click (or enter) to edit\n","\n","\n","\n","reverse_string = ''\n","reverse_string = reverse_string + 'a'\n","print(reverse_string)\n","reverse_string = reverse_string + 'b'\n","print(reverse_string)\n","a\n","ab\n","\n","[ ]\n","string_a = 'nobel'\n","string_a[::-1]\n","\n","\n","[ ]\n","# aman -> nama, radar -> radar,\n","\n","# input_string = input(\"Input the string to check palindrome: \")\n","input_string = 'radar'\n","reverse_string = ''\n","# reverse_string = reverse_string + 'a'\n","print(input_string, input_string[0], len(input_string))\n","\n","for i in range(len(input_string)-1, -1, -1):\n","  reverse_string = reverse_string + input_string[i]\n","  print(i, input_string[i], reverse_string)\n","\n","if input_string == reverse_string:\n","  print(\"Palindrome\")\n","else:\n","  print(\"Not Palindrome\")\n","radar r 5\n","4 r r\n","3 a ra\n","2 d rad\n","1 a rada\n","0 r radar\n","Palindrome\n","Problem 10: Even numbers from list\n","Let’s say I give you a list saved in a variable: random_list = [1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100].
